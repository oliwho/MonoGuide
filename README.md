# MonoGuide
This is a free to use climbing guide for Vienna 

This application is a project for the climbing community and contains information 
about lead climbing areas around Vienna. Different areas can be saved on the device 
to also access them offline. Therefore, but also due to environmental reasons, the network 
traffic of the application is reduced to a minimum (except Ads.).  This app is free to use 
and will remain that way, because the information provided here is public and should therefore be freely available.  
There will be ads placed in the app to cover server costs and any repairs or upgrades.  
Since the development of this app was done independently, some features were omitted in the first version. 
This is not meant to be a competitor product to the existing guides, but a free alternative.
This app should not be limited to Vienna and its surroundings. If there are areas that you think belong
in this app and you have more access to that area, feel free to contact us at info@future-climbing-club.com. 
Due to the history of Vienna Climbing Guides, 15% of advertising revenue will be donated for local projects.  
It took a lot of work and love to realize this app. Our offer shall remain free of charge, if you still want to donate something,
feel free to do so at: above.  We hope you have as much fun with the app as we had developing it.
